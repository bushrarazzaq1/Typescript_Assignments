// Assignment No : 6

// Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

let personNameWithWhiteSpaces = "\t\n Bushra Abdul Razzaq \n\t";
console.log("Name With White Space:", personNameWithWhiteSpaces);

let strippedName = personNameWithWhiteSpaces.trim(); 
// The trim() method is a built-in function in TypeScript (and JavaScript) that removes any whitespace characters (like spaces, tabs, and newline characters) from the beginning and end of a string.
console.log("Stripped Name:", strippedName)
